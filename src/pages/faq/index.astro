    question: `Do I need to have a trial for bridal makeup?`,
    answer: `A trial is recommended for all bridal clients, this will give you the chance to trial your desired makeup look and trial the products on your skin.

        A trial will also give you confidence so you can relax on your wedding day knowing the exact result you will attain.

        However if you really do not wish to have a trial or it's not possible, you will not be pressured into having one.

        Contact me for quotes.

  {
    question: `Will my makeup last all day?`,
    answer: `I have tried and tested many products and ask many questions to ensure I'm using the right products for your skin type and to ensure longevity. 

        So long as you don't touch your face throughout the day your makeup will stay put. The only thing you may wish to touch up would be your lips.
